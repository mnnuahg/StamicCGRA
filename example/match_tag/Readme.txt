This example show different tag matching mechanisms. Tag matching mechanism will re-order the tokens so that tokens with the same tags are outputed together.
To do this we must have some signaling mechanism to let a PE know that all other PEs have received the token with the same tag.
match_tag1.xlsx use signal tokens while match_tag2.xlsx uses shared bus for the signaling.
