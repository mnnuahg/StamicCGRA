The example computes the population count (number of bit 1) of the input token. The population count of a number X is computed by iteratively execute X = X&(X-1) and count how many iterations are required for X to reach 0.
The input and output PEs are 1B and 5B for popcount1, and 1B and 9B for popcount2. You can search them in the output message.
The initial input is a token 0x10f, which means 0x1 for tag and 0xf for data. The input is specified in grid 1A as an initial data in the output FIFO R0.
